### Redis keys available on the system at time of read operation ###
I polled our current active keys on our Redis server in the morning. We had approximately 5000 keys. 
The patterns of all keys can be summarized by the following list:

{STR_ID}_{GUID}_{GUID} **
{GUID}_{GUID}_{GUID} **
{GUID} **
IsFeatureActive#ad_emit_events#{INT_ID}
IsFeatureActive#autoschedule#{INT_ID}
IsFeatureActive#dealassetstatus#{INT_ID}
IsFeatureActive#deliverymodule#{INT_ID}
IsFeatureActive#enabletags#{INT_ID}
IsFeatureActive#enforceassetavailability#{INT_ID}
IsFeatureActive#eventsmodule#{INT_ID}
IsFeatureActive#extendedseason#{INT_ID}
KonnectOrganization#{STR_ID}
KonnectOrganization#{GUID}
KonnectOrganizationData#{INT_ID}
KoreSetting#UnallocatedRevenueProperty#{GUID}
tableauconfig#{INT_ID}
UsersCommentsOrganization#{STR_ID}

** These three patterns made for approximately 4800 of the key's on the list.
